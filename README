The purpose of this README file is to let the reader know how to run this specific Rummy program and to add
information about its making.

1. First and foremost there are two ways to run this program but only one works as intended.
    -Write java Proj2 
     and it will run it from the GUI which runs correctly but doesn't follow any rules
     since I could not figure out how to work with the GUI well enough.

    
    -Write: 'java Rummy' in the terminal while inside the directory
        
        and it will run an immediate simulated game of Rummy between two extremely
        idiotic computer players who follow the Rummy rules to heart.
        This is the recommended way to run this code, as the rules are being followed.


2. Assistance during the making of the code
    During the making of the Rummy.java file, I collaborated with another student named Jantony Velazquez Gauthier 
    because I needed assistance as to how to even begin coding the play() function and the student gave me bumps and
    tips to follow in order to make the function like helping figure out the logic and path I wanted to choose to work
    with the solution to the play() function. I also requested some assistance with minor Java syntax with two friends
    who are off-campus.


3. Extra credit.
    To my own knowledge, I was not able to do any extra credit work.
